
for loop vs for each loop

1) For primitive types
for loop is faster than for each loop
2) But For Collections
 for each loop is faster than for loop

for-each vs iterator in Collections

fore-each will not allow modification - gives modificationnotallowed exception
iterator will allow modification

both are almost of same efficiencies

--------
Iterator vs Enumeration

Enumeration - applicable only for legacy classes - hashtable/vector
Iterator - applicable for modern collections
Enumeration doesnot allow remove/modification
Iterator allows the same.
