By Default the Context of any Function JS is window
CALL
we can change using call
method
say for instance
function greet(greeting,name)
{
console.log(greeting+"Good Day "+name);
}
greet("Hello","Rajan");//IS A NORMAL CALL WITH DEFAULT INDEX
but greet.call("mycontext","Hello","Rajan") with first argument being the context

and second and third are the usual args of the method greer

CALL is used to change the context

APPLY 
CAN BE USED IN SAME MANNER
BUT ARGS CAN BE PASSED AS AN ARRAY

arr1=["Good Day","Rajan"];
greet.apply("mycontext",arr1)


passing null as a context value will not overwrite the context
but retains the default context like for eg."window" as context

BIND


var greetBound = greet.bind('world') //CONTEXT IS CHANGED TO "world"

we can hold it in a variable
REUSABLE
greetBound();
greetBound("Good Day","Rajan")

to call the greet("Good Day","Rajan") with the context as 'world'
