---------------

My env: java version "1.8.0_144"

Eclipse: Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Oxygen Release (4.7.0) Build id: 20170620-1800

Exit Eclipse(if it is open) and download jar from https://projectlombok.org/download

(Go into the folder where lombok jar is installed there you execute following command in the command prompt)
execute command: java -jar lombok.jar


This command will open window as shown here https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse, install and quit the installer.

Add jar to build path/add it to pom.xml.

e.g. for Gradle build

 annotationProcessor("org.projectlombok:lombok")
 compileOnly("org.projectlombok:lombok")
restart eclipse.
Go to Eclipse --> About Eclipse --> check 'Lombok v1.16.18 "Dancing Elephant" is installed. https://projectlombok.org/'
To enable Lombok for the project: Enable annotation processing in the respective IDE. That's it. It worked. I did not change eclipse init script.
