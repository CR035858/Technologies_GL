================================================

JpaRepository vs CRUDRepository

JpaRepository implements PagingAndSortingRepository extends CrudRespository

Pagination I guess you understand is a facility allowed when we deal with data that has numerous records more than a Page full.


SpringBoot provides this feature, through the interfaces and classes
[Pageable, PageRequest, Page]

Pageable is an interface which helps in defining a request for a specific page

PageRequest is an implementation of Pageable containing, information on which page is to be requested
How many records per page, sorting order etc

Page is a chunk of results/records

When we say PageRequest.of(1,3) we are asking for 3 records from 1 using PageRequest and this 
Object Reference is held in "Pageable"
0,1,2,3.....
		Pageable first3records = PageRequest.of(1, 3);
		return readRepository.findAll(first3records);

When we pass this Objectfor example first3Records(Pageable) containing info on what pages to be retrieved
it will fetch data from our Repository's findAll method based on our Pagination rule
findAll fetches all records from which we filter based on the rule defined in Pageable
i.e first 3 records

Hope you got this.
