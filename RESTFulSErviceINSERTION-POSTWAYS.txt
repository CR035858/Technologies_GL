Yes Subhasish,

Actually you are inserting records in this RestFul service using 3 different ways

1) Using RequestParam

RequestParam is RequestParameters , i.e we are passing the values of the Fields for the Record that is to be inserted using variables
Your Controller Method looks like this (this is how you can use RequestParams):

@PostMapping("/addBookReqParam")
 public String addBook(
    @RequestParam("bname") String bname,
    @RequestParam("author") String author,
    @RequestParam("cat") String category)
 {
 Book b1=new Book(bname,author,category);
 bookservice.addBook(b1);
 return "Book Added Successfully";
 }

Here in your case bname,author,category are RequestParams, we need not give id because id is autogenerated
The values that we enter in POSTMAN are passed to these variables
I have shown it in the snapshot : NewSnap2

HTTP method  should be POST , In the snapshot I have numbered it look for the Number 1
If you can select the Params  as shown in Number 3 in  the snapshot

you need to enter the variable names as bname,author,category without spelling mistakes as shown in 
Number4 in the snapshot values for these variables should be entered as shown in Number5

which automatically shows the  URL modified in the address as shown in  Number2 in the Snapshot

Then you click on send it should insert the record


------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Using RequestObject

We can insert the Record by passing the Record as JSON Object , the Controller looks as shown below in your case
@PostMapping("/addBookReqBody")
 public String addBookReqBody(@RequestBody Book b1)
 {
 System.out.println(b1.getAuthor());
 bookservice.addBook(b1);
 return "Book Added Successfully";
 }

Inserting the Record for this  I have shown in the SNAPSHOT : NewSnap3

You need to click on BODY numbered as 1 in the Snapshot and  select "raw" , numbered as 2 in the snapshot
and select JSON  , numbered as 3 in the snapshot, then in the BOX below numbered as 4 you need to enter the following for example

{

    "title": "Tom And Jerry",
    "author": "Shakespeare",
    "category": "Comic"
}

Format should be exactly the same title,author & category are your variable names of the Class "Book"
any casing error,spelling error it throws error Try understanding the JSON format as key value pair, keys are your class Book variables and values as per the need

URL to access is    http://localhost:8080/library/addBookReqBody

Because your controller RequestMap  is   

@PostMapping("/addBookReqBody")   in the Controller

Dont forget to select POST (number5   in snapshot) and then send it will insert the record
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Using PathVariables
For the Path Variables
HTTP request Method is POST  numbered  as 1 in the SNAPSHOT : NewSnap4

Path Variables can be supplied in the URL itself

Your Controller Method is as follows

@PostMapping("/addBookPathVariables/{bname}/{author}/{cat}")
 public String addBookPathVariables(
   @PathVariable("bname") String bname,
   @PathVariable("author") String author,
   @PathVariable("cat") String category)
 {
 Book b1=new Book(bname,author,category);
 bookservice.addBook(b1);
 return "Book Added Successfully";
 }

THE URL in the addressbar of POSTMAN should be (you need to type this)

http://localhost:8080/library/addBookPathVariables/T&J/Shakes/Drama 
numbered as 2

for example the pathVariables are filled this way:
T&J   will take the place of "bname" in the line @PostMapping("/addBookPathVariables/{bname}/{author}/{cat}")
Shakes(peare) will take the place of "author" in the line @PostMapping("/addBookPathVariables/{bname}/{author}/{cat}")
Drama will take the place of cat in the line @PostMapping("/addBookPathVariables/{bname}/{author}/{cat}")


This will insert the record when you click on SEND

These are the ways to insert records in a RESTFul service


Hope you understood


Thanks
