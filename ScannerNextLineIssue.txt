Use it this way

----------------
Scanner scan1 = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter String ");
		String str1 = scan1.nextLine();

		System.out.println("Enter String");
		String str2 = scan1.next();
		
		
		scan1.nextLine();

		System.out.println("Enter String ");
		String str3 = scan1.nextLine();
		
		
		System.out.println(str1+" "+str2+" "+str3);

---------------

That's because the Scanner.next method does not read the newline character in the input that is  created by pressing "Enter," and therefore the call to Scanner.nextLine returns after reading that newline.

Hope that resolves your issue
Thanks
